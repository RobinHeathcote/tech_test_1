## Assumptions for questions

  For some questions the wording was a little ambiguous so I made the following assumptions:

  ```
  4) I assumed the largest string to equal the longest based on characters.
  6) I assumed that the rounding still occurs for numbers above .5 as normal
  9) I have given three answers. The first two convert the array into a set and I have left
  as comments because they do not maintain the sorting of the array however, this was not
  specified if it was required in the test.  The second option I don't think is very readable
  but I found it interesting so left it in. I also read that these were quite slow so they are
  not viable for large data sets. The final solution does maintain the sorting of the array 
  but I am not sure if the enumerable #group_by counts as internal sorting. 
  If it does please let me know and I will give another solution.

  ```
